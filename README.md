# Miscellaneous projects

In here I'll upload smaller files/projects that I'll further explain going down the list.


--------------------------------------------
An Attempt at a Connect4 game in C
--------------------------------------------

As the name suggests, the goal was to create a game similiar or exactly like Connect 4 but in C and only using the terminal to show the board. 


--------------------------------------------
First ever "working" website I made
--------------------------------------------

This project was made for my final exam in my Web Design course, and suffice to say there are rougher elements in it but also in a nostalgic haze I still like some elements of it. 



--------------------------------------------
The list of SQL commands used during a final exam
--------------------------------------------

This is a txt file filled with an assortement of SQL commands we were tasked to use as answers to the tasks given to us for our final grade. 



--------------------------------------------
Software testing and Quality assurance project
--------------------------------------------

The concept/practice here was that I was given a project that needed to be tested and checked to make sure that any and all errors in logic or flow were correctly found, written up and then made aware to the author.
